  CRUX — The Intellectual Arena
</h1>

> *One claim. One arena. No neutral ground.*

CRUX is an AI-powered debate platform where statements are judged before they reach the arena. The AI decides if your claim has enough tension to become a live argument — then scores every comment, updates both sides' analysis in real time, and shifts win probability as the debate evolves.

---

## What Makes It Different

- **AI Gatekeeping** — Every submitted statement is evaluated for controversy potential, logical viability, and debate merit. Weak claims don't survive.
- **Live Analysis** — Both sides of every argument have a continuously updated AI analysis that evolves as users post comments.
- **Logic Scoring** — Every comment is scored 4–8 based on novelty, reasoning quality, and argumentative strength. Scores update your global Logic Score.
- **Abuse Detection** — Comments are screened for English and Hindi abuse before posting. Violations deduct from your Logic Score.
- **Win Probability** — Once both sides have at least one comment, the AI calculates a live probability split based on argument quality.
- **Debater Profiles** — Your intellectual identity is inferred from your argument history. Not what you argued — how you think.

## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/) (free tier available)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitesh-Kumar-7557/crux
cd crux
```

---

### 2. Environment Variables

Rename `pgadmin.example.env` to `pgadmin.env` and replace email password of your choice.

Rename `.env.example` file in both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories to `.env`

and add your Groq api key inside `backend/.env`

**LLM provider (optional).** By default the backend talks to Groq using `GROQ_API_KEY`. To point it at any OpenAI-compatible provider (e.g. OpenRouter) without code changes, set:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | Chat-completions base URL |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | falls back to `GROQ_API_KEY` | API key for the provider |
| `LLM_MODEL_SMART` | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | Model for the arbiter, analysis, and scoring calls |
| `LLM_MODEL_FAST` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Model for the debater-description call |

Example for OpenRouter: `LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, `LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-...`, `LLM_MODEL_SMART=deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`.

---

### 3. Run the Stack

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This will ->  Start a PostgreSQL instance on port `5432` and PgAdmin on port `5051`

```bash
cd backend && npm i
```
```bash
npm run db-init  
# if this shows error, then it's already ran, skip it!
```

This will ->  Migrate the tables and seed the data into the database.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will ->  Start the Express backend on port `8000`

Now on a new terminal window

```bash
cd frontend && npm i && npm run dev
```

This will ->  Start the Next.js frontend on port `3000`


---

### 4. Open the App

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Stopping the Stack

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

To also remove the database volume (full reset):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
```
